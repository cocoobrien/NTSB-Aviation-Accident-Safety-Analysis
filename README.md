# NTSB-Aviation-Accident-Safety-Analysis
Project aims to provide critical insights into the root causes of aviation accidents over the past decade. 

# Project Description: 

Utilized Tableau to analyze National Transportation Safety Board data, addressing specific queries pertinent to FAA concerns on aircraft types, seasonal patterns, operational phases, defining events, and specific accident causes most associated with aviation accidents. Designed an intuitive dashboard with time-series graphs, geospatial density maps, intuitive bar graphs, drill-down functionality, interactivity, and key metrics to provide critical insights into aviation safety trends, contributing to informed strategies for accident prevention. The objective is to inform targeted strategies for mitigating aviation accidents in the United States.

Data Source: The data, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board and spanning 2012 to 2021, comprises over 12,000 rows of information on U.S. aircraft accidents.

# Details: 
The dashboard employs a user-friendly interface designed to facilitate nuanced exploration of aviation accidents. The time-series graph at the top center offers a comprehensive overview of accident trends from 2012 to 2021, allowing users to identify patterns and cyclical trends. The geospatial density map, strategically positioned in the center, provides a visual representation of global accident distribution, offering insights into geographical risk areas.

Key metrics, including total accidents and fatalities, are presented on the right-hand side, allowing users to filter and focus on specific aircraft types and manufacturers. The horizontal stacked bar graph highlights causes of accidents, incorporating a gradient of blue shades to denote severity. Another dual-axis bar graph explores the correlation between policy recommendations and accident counts over the years, shedding light on the impact of safety measures.

The analysis reveals significant findings, such as the cyclical nature of accidents during summer months, a correlation between warmer climates and accident clustering, and the effectiveness of policy recommendations in reducing accidents. The user-centric design and thoughtful incorporation of filters, key metrics, and various visualizations contribute to a robust and enlightening user experience.

In conclusion, the project underscores the importance of strategic data visualization choices in conveying insights about aviation accidents. The thoughtful design decisions and analysis provide a valuable tool for understanding accident patterns, causes, and the efficacy of safety measures over time. The project emphasizes the need for flexibility and adaptability in visualization formats to cater to diverse audiences and user needs, ensuring effective communication of complex data.

# Project Analysis: 
This data visualization project, "Aviation Accidents (2012â€“2021)," aimed to enhance aviation safety by analyzing a decade of National Transportation Safety Board data. The project responded to specific inquiries of FAA investigation and concern, focusing on aircraft types, seasonal patterns, and accident causes. Through meticulous design decisions and the utilization of Tableau, the resulting dashboard offered a comprehensive understanding of aviation accident trends. The analysis uncovered notable insights, including seasonal correlations, geographical risk areas, and the impact of policy recommendations on accident trends. The project's findings contribute valuable information for formulating targeted safety measures and improving aviation regulations, ultimately advancing the goal of accident prevention within the aviation industry.
